Data format and usage:

Format:  Society of Exploration Geophysicists Y Format (SEG-Y)

Usage:  SEG-Y format data files can be accessed by numerous licensed geophysical processing and interpretation software packages (e.g. ProMAX, Reveal, Petrel, etc.) 
and also by Public Domain sharware (SEISEE, Seismic Unix, etc.)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data processing:

Date Processed: October, 2018-April, 2019
Data Processor:  Land Seismic Noise Specialists, Denver, Colorado, under contract to Utah FORGE
Data processing:  Data processing was performed by LSNS using commercially available software (Reveal) and proprietary software developed in-house.

Generalized Processing Flow: Geometry corrections, QC Trace edits, refraction statics calculation and application, Amplitude balancing, Pre-deconvolution noise attenuation: airblast denoise, spectral edit denoise, proprietary LSNS denoise, Iterative velocity and residual statics analysis (2 passes), Spiking Deconvolution (180ms filter) and 
post-deconvolution noise attenuation – spectral edit and despike, Offset bin interpolation (3D only), CDP Stacking and post stack enhancements, Pre-stack time migration velocity analysis on migrated gathers, Pre-stack time migration and post-stack enhancements, Pre-stack depth migration velocity analysis and model building,
Pre-stack depth migration using an estimated anisotropic velocity model and post-stack enhancements, Bandpass Filter (4-8-80-120 hz)
